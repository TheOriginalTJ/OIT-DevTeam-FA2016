# OIT-DevTeam-FA2016
This group exists in order to develop a program for OIT and the School Registrar that will read in an excel (csv) file with a list of courses and requirements, and then format the classes into a schedule (csv or excel file). Ideally, this schedule will then be loaded into the school's database. There will be additional functionality like adding and deleting a single class at a time based on course name, description, etc.
